# Modelling NLP with Tensorflow

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a sentiment classification model capable of analysing text from tweets on Twitter and determining whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative or neutral. In this project, we used TensorFlow, an open-source library for machine learning that enables efficient development and training of deep learning models. The project involves various stages of natural language processing (NLP) to prepare text data before it is used to train sentiment classification models.

## Objective
- Create and train an effective deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify the sentiment of tweets on Twitter.
- This model will utilise neural network architectures suitable for text classification tasks, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
- Experiment with various hyperparameters and regularization techniques to improve model performance.

## Tools
- Google Colaboratory
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- SciKit-Learn
- Pandas
- Ziplife
